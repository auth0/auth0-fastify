## Testing

In order to test the SDK in a project outside of this repository, you can use the following steps:

- git clone this repository
- run `npm install` in the root of the repository
- run `npm run build --workspaces` in the root of the repository
- run `npm pack --workspaces` in the root of the repository

This creates the following three files:
- `packages/auth0-auth-js/auth0-auth0-auth-js-<version>.tgz`
- `packages/auth0-server-js/auth0-auth0-server-js-<version>.tgz`
- `packages/auth0-fastify/auth0-auth0-fastify-<version>.tgz`

The above tarballs can be installed in your project using `npm install <path-to-tarball>`.
For example, `npm install ../path/to/repo/packages/auth0-auth-js/auth0-auth-js-<version>.tgz`.

Note that, if you need to use `auth0-server-js`, you also need to install the tarbal for `auth0-auth-js` as `auth0-server-js` depends on `auth0-auth-js`.
Same goes for `auth0-fastify` which depends on `auth0-server-js`, meaning when you need to install `auth0-fastify`, you also need to install `auth0-server-js` and `auth0-auth-js`.
If all you need is `auth0-auth-js`, you can just install that tarball.

> WARNING: The tarballs are not meant for production use. They are meant for testing purposes only.
