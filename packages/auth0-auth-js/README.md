The `@auth0/auth0-auth-js` library provides API's to interact with Auth0's Authentication Api's from withing JavaScript applications.

It contains methods to build Authorization URLs and Logout URLs, implement Backchannel Logout, verifying a logout token, and to request Tokens using the Authorization Code Flow and Refresh Tokens, as well as retrieving a Token for a Connection.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the SDK

```shell
npm i @auth0/auth0-auth-js
```

This library requires Node.js 20 LTS and newer LTS versions.

### 2. Create the Auth0 SDK client

Create an instance of the `AuthClient`. This instance will be imported and used anywhere we need access to the authentication methods.


```ts
import { AuthClient } from '@auth0/auth0-auth-js';

const authClient = new AuthClient({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  clientSecret: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET>',
});
```

The `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` can be obtained from the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com) once you've created an application.

### 3. Build the Authorization URL

Build the URL to redirect the user-agent to to request authorization at Auth0.

```ts
const authClient = new AuthClient({
  // ...
  authorizationParams: {
    redirect_uri: '<AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI>',
  },
  // ...
});

The `AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI` is needed to tell Auth0 what URL to redirect back to after successfull authentication, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to register the `AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI` in your Auth0 Application as an **Allowed Callback URL** via the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).

In order to build the authorization URL, call `buildAuthorizationUrl()`, and redirect the user to the returned URL.

```ts
const { authorizationUrl, codeVerifier } = await authClient.buildAuthorizationUrl();
```

- `authorizationUrl`: The URL to redirect the user to.
- `codeVerifier`: The code verifier that should be stored and used when exchanging the code for tokens.

### 4. Build the Logout URL

Build the URL to redirect the user-agent to to request logout at Auth0.

```ts
const logoutUrl = authClient.buildLogoutUrl({
  returnTo: '<AUTH0_LOGOUT_RETURN_URL>',
});
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to register the `AUTH0_LOGOUT_RETURN_URL` in your Auth0 Application as an **Allowed Logout URL** via the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).

The `AUTH0_LOGOUT_RETURN_URL` is needed to tell Auth0 what URL to redirect back to after successfully logging out, e.g. `http://localhost:3000`.
