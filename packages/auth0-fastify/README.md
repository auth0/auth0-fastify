## Getting Started

### 1. Install the SDK

```shell
npm i @auth0/auth0-fastify
```

This library requires Node.js 20 LTS and newer LTS versions.

### 2. Register the Auth0 Fastify plugin

Register the Auth0 fastify plugin with the Fastify instance.


```ts
import auth0 from '@auth0/auth0-fastify';

fastify.register(auth0, {
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  clientSecret: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET>',
  appBaseUrl: '<APP_BASE_URL>',
  secret: '<SESSION_SECRET>'
});
```

The `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` can be obtained from the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com) once you've created an application. **This application must be a `Regular Web Application`**.

The `SESSION_SECRET` is the key used to encrypt the session and transaction cookies. You can generate a secret using `openssl`:

```shell
openssl rand -hex 64
```

The `APP_BASE_URL` is the URL that your application is running on. When developing locally, this is most commonly `http://localhost:3000`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to register the following URLs in your Auth0 Application via the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com):
>
> - Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to the list of **Allowed Callback URLs**
> - Add `http://localhost:3000` to the list of **Allowed Logout URLs**
                                                                                     |

## Routes

The SDK mounts 5 routes:

1. `/auth/login`: the login route that the user will be redirected to to initiate an authentication transaction
2. `/auth/logout`: the logout route that must be added to your Auth0 application's Allowed Logout URLs
3. `/auth/callback`: the callback route that must be added to your Auth0 application's Allowed Callback URLs
4. `/auth/profile`: the route to return the user information
5. `/auth/backchannel-logout`: the route that will receive a `logout_token` when a configured Back-Channel Logout initiator occurs
